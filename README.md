## Unfixed Bugs

__Home Page Video Responsiveness__

 - Description: The home page video is not fully responsive. If you zoom in, the video does not adjust correctly after a specific size.
 
 - Reason Not Fixed: Unfortunately, due to the time constraints, I was not able to fix this minor error. The issue arises from limitations in the CSS framework used, which does not fully support responsive video scaling under certain conditions. However, it is definitely something that I will address in the near future to ensure a fully responsive design across all devices and screen sizes.

 - Future Fix: I plan to implement a more robust responsive design for the video, potentially using a different approach such as a CSS framework that better supports responsive media elements or custom CSS to handle video scaling more effectively.

 ## Deployment

__Deployment to GitHub Pages__

The live link can be found here - https://ts2017185.github.io/castletours/ 

Deploying the Castle Tours website to GitHub Pages involves several steps. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

__Steps to Deploy__

1. Create a GitHub Repository:

    - Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
    - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
    - Name your repository (e.g., castletours), add a description, and choose whether it will be public or private.
    - Initialize the repository with a README file.

2. Clone the Repository:

    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/castletours.git
    ```
    Replace '__your-username__' with your GitHub username.

3. Add Project Files:

    - Copy all the project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into the cloned repository directory.
    - Ensure your '__index.html__' file is in the root directory of the repository, as GitHub Pages uses this file as the entry point for the site.

4. Commit and Push Changes:

    - Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.
    Add all the files to the staging area using:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    - Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
    ```
    git commit -m "Initial commit with project files"
    ```
    - Push the changes to GitHub:
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```
    - Note: If your default branch is '__master__', replace '__main__' with '__master__'.

5. Enable GitHub Pages:

    - Go to your repository on GitHub.
    - Click on "Settings" in the repository menu.
    - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
    - Under "Source," select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., '__main__' or '__master__').
    - Click "Save."

6. Access Your Website:

    - After enabling GitHub Pages, you will see a URL where your site is hosted. It will be in the format:
    ```
    https://your-username.github.io/castletours/
    ```
    Visit this URL to see your live site.

__Continuous Deployment__

- Commit and Push Changes: Whenever you make updates to your project, commit and push the changes to the same branch you have configured for GitHub Pages.

- Automatic Updates: GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and update your site with the latest changes.
